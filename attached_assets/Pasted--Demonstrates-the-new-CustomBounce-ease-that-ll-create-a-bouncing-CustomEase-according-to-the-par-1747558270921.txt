/*
Demonstrates the new CustomBounce ease that'll create a bouncing CustomEase according to the parameters you feed in (like strength and squash)
and also [optionally] create an accompanying "squash" ease curve that is perfectly synchronized with the bounce so that you can apply
other complimentary effects that kick in on the bounce (typically squashing/stretching). 

Special properties:

- strength: a value between 0 and 1 (default: 0.7) that controls the bounciness. The higher the number, the more bouncy.

- squash: A number that controls how much of a gap is introduced between each bounce to make room for the "squash" to happen. A common value is 2. Default is 0 (no squash)

- jump: if true, the bounce will end where it starts, meaning it'll act like it's jumping toward whatever value you define, and then falls back toward the starting value.

- squashID: The ID (name) that you want assigned to the squish CustomEase. By default, it will simply append "-squash" to the name you give the bounce. 

In the example, the green line is the bounce, and the brown line is the accompanying squash ease. Play with the strength/squash values and see what happens.

If you think about the physics of a ball bouncing (one that’s really bouncy/squashy), when it hits the ground it doesn’t INSTANTLY go back up; it strikes, compresses (so it’s still on the ground this whole time), then transfers energy back up and takes off again. That's the "stick" or gap in the bounce. The squash.

//the bounce:
var duration = 5;
TweenMax.to("#ball", duration, {delay:0.2, y:550, ease:"myBounce", repeat:8, repeatDelay:0.5});
//the squish which affects scaleX and scaleY. To make the effect stronger/weaker, just change the scaleX/scaleY values:
TweenMax.to("#ball", duration, {delay:0.2, scaleX:1.34, scaleY:0.5, ease:"myBounce-squash", transformOrigin:"bottom center", repeat:8, repeatDelay:0.5});
